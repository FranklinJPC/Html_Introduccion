    <h1>Personaje</h1>
    <h2>Rodelika</h2>
    <p>
        A Tarnished driven away from her home across the sea. 
        The cloak she wears implies that she used to be a member of royalty. 
        At some point upon arriving at the Lands Between, 
        she happened upon White Mask Varre, who gave her the same advice as he gives the 
        Tarnished at the beginning of their journey - to seek Godrick and his Great Rune 
        at Stormveil Castle. Upon arriving at Stormhill, the men escorting her were taken 
        and sacrificed for grafting, leaving her in guilt about the fact that she's too afraid to join them.

        She moves to the Roundtable Hold to find purpose after receiving the hopeful 
        echoes of her men through the Chrysalids' Memento. Here, Smithing Master Hewg recognises 
        her potential for spirit tuning through her eyes, and with a bit of encouragement from the Tarnished, 
        trains her to be a skillful spirit tuner. The two become close, and even as the Roundtable Hold is 
        burning down, she stays behind with him to repay his kindness.
